# 1. Getting Started

## <li> Prerequisites </li>

- [Roblox Studio](https://roblox.com)
- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/setup/Ubuntu) (if you're on linux)
- [Vinegar](https://flathub.org/apps/org.vinegarhq.Vinegar) (if you're on linux)

## <li> Starting </li>

First, create a new project (baseplate)
<br>
(image)

Poser une part (resize un peu, rotate toussa, anchored) <br>
Créer votre premier script (rendre une part transparente après 10 secondes) (link to doc) <br>
Créer une ui basique <br>

Once you created your project, your first step will be to save it, give it a name and make sure team create is turned on.

# New world, new buildings, learn how to place a Part!
Your first goal is to place a part in the workspace, and set its size to (3, 3, 3), and make sure it's anchored.

# New world, new rules, make your first script!
Usually, developers start with making a print("hello world") script, but if you noticed, making a new script in roblox studio just does that by default! <br>
Erase that line, and start making your own script! <br>
Your goal: making the part invisible after 10 seconds. (You can ask questions, but your most useful ressource will be the [documentation](#useful-links)
